INFORMATION = """Suits is an American legal drama television series created and written by Aaron Korsh.
Produced by Universal Content Productions, it premiered on USA Network on June 23, 2011.

Set in a fictional New York City corporate law firm, the series follows Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams),
a college dropout with a photographic memory, as he works as an associate for the successful and
charismatic attorney, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht).[1] Suits focuses on Harvey and Mike winning
lawsuits and closing cases, while at the same time hiding Mike's secret of never having attended
law school.[2] It also features Rick Hoffman as Louis Litt, a neurotic, manipulative and
unscrupulous financial-law partner; Meghan Markle as the ambitious, talented paralegal Rachel
Zane; Sarah Rafferty as Harvey's legal secretary and confidante Donna Paulsen; and Gina Torres as
the firm's profit-above-all managing partner, Jessica Pearson.

On January 30, 2018, the series was renewed for an eighth season, but Torres, Adams, and Markle
left the show.[3] Katherine Heigl joined the cast as Samantha Wheeler. Recurring characters Alex
Williams (Dul√© Hill) and Katrina Bennett (Amanda Schull) were promoted to series regulars.[4]
The show was renewed for a 10-episode ninth and final season on January 23, 2019, which premiered
on July 17, 2019.[5][6]"""
